# Plot output functions for analysis of Fisher's iris data set
# Author: Fiachra O' Donoghue

"""
These functions abstract away some of the details of producing 
plots from the iris dataset while also providing a simple interface
for some basic tinkering with the plots. 

Keeping these functions in a dedicated plots file will hopefully keep
the main analysis file more manageable in terms of length and comlexity.
