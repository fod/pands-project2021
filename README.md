## Introduction
Fisher's Iris Data set is a collection of 50 observations of four measurements - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width from each of three plant species: *Iris setosa*, *I. versicolor*, and *I. virginica*. Two of these sets (*I. setosa* and *I. versicolor*) were collected from plants growing together in the same colony, while the third (*I. virginica*) was collected from elsewhere (Fisher, 1936). Fisher (*ibid.*) demonstrated that *I. setosa* is linearly separable from the other two species based on a function of the four measurements recorded whereas *I. vesicolor* and *I. virginica* were not.
